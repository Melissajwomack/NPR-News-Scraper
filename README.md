# NPR News Scraper

## About the App
Full stack web app that displays articles from NPR's website. The app includes links to the original article, a save article feature, and allows users to write, delete, and view comments on the articles. 

## How to Use the App
Go to this link: https://stormy-inlet-29856.herokuapp.com/. If no articles are found on the site, click "Scrape Articles". Once articles are populated, click the link symbol to go to the original article, the plus symbol to save, and the comment symbol to comment. When an article is saved, it can be found by clicking on the "Saved Articles" link. After the comment symbol has been clicked, a modal will appear allowing you to type text into the text box. After clicking "Add Comment", the comment is saved and the modal will close. Just click the comment symbol for that article again to view your comment, and press the "x" next to your comment to delete it. Finally, to clear all articles (INCLUDING SAVED ARTICLES) click the button "Clear All Articles".
